/*
A short definition provides a highly abridged version of the main definition section, consisting of just the definition text for the first three senses. It is not meant to be displayed along with the full entry, but instead as an alternative, shortened preview of the entry content.

Display Guidance
Each element in the shortdef array represents a distinct definition, and needs to be separated from the next element by a newline, sense number, or the like.
Note this section should not be displayed alongside the main definition section content, but only in specialized contexts where a preview or shortened entry view is needed.
